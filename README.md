Open Source Community: **Gravity** is an [ORM framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping) for Relativity custom development.  Using Gravity will greatly decrease the amount of time it takes to pick up Relativity development and allow you to write code that interacts with Relativity with commonly used C# syntax.

While this project is hosted on the RelativityDev account, support is only available through the Relativity developer community. You are welcome to use the code and solution as you see fit within the confines of the license it is released under. However, if you are looking for support or modifications to the solution, we suggest reaching out to a Relativity Development Partner.

Gravity was originally created by TSD Services.   Through their generosity and leadership, they have released the project as open source.  It is an active project and has contributions from other Relativity Development Partners.  Anyone who has a need is invited to use and contribute to the project.  If you are interested in contributing, check out the open issues and Wiki pages.

We would like to recognize the following Relativity Development Partners who have made significant contributions to the Gravity project:

This is also available as a [nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RelativityDev.Gravity).

## Target Frameworks
* .NET 4.5.1, .NET 4.6.2

## Dependencies
This project requires references to Relativity's RelativityÂ® SDK dlls, which are referenced via Nuget packages. As such, DLL versions 9.4.224.2 and up are supported.

## Sample / Test Suite

Information about the demo application and accompanying integration tests is available on a [separate page](SampleGettingStarted.md).

## Usage Guide
Before using the CRUD/Q methods in Gravity you will have to create a model and decorate it with the appropriate attributes:

* `RelativityObject` - Specifies the type Guid of the RDO you are targeting.
* `RelativityObjectField` - Specifies the type Guid and the "RdoFieldType" of the RDO field you are targeting.
* `RelativityObjectChildrenList` - Used to decorate a List of child RDOs as a object List.
* `RelativityObjectFieldParentArtifactId` - If the RDO is a child object, used to specify that the RDO field contains the ParentArtifactID

The following example demonstrates a RDO represented as a Model:
```csharp
[Serializable]
[RelativityObject("0B5C62E0-2AFA-4408-B7FF-789351C9BEDC")]
public class DemoPurchaseOrder : BaseDto
{
	[RelativityObjectField("E1FA93B9-C2DB-442A-9978-84EEB6B61A3F", RdoFieldType.FixedLengthText, 255)]
	public override string Name { get; set; }

	[RelativityObjectField("37159592-B5B6-4405-AF74-10B5728890B4", RdoFieldType.WholeNumber)]
	public int OrderNumber { get; set; }

	[RelativityObjectField("37159592-B5B6-4405-AF74-10B5728890B4", RdoFieldType.FixedLengthText, 100)]
	public string CustomerName { get; set; }

	[RelativityObjectField("3BDC0971-A87C-414E-9A37-FC477279BBAD", RdoFieldType.FixedLengthText, 100)]
	public string CustomerEmail { get; set; }

	[RelativityObjectField("D0770889-8A4D-436A-9647-33419B96E37E"), RdoFieldType.MultipleObject)]
	public IList<Items> Items { get; set; }

	[RelativityObjectField("D0770889-8A4D-436A-9647-33419B96E37E"), RdoFieldType.SingleObject)]
	public Address Address { get; set; }

	[RelativityObjectField("4501A308-5E68-4314-AEDC-4DEB527F12A8", RdoFieldType.Decimal)]
	public decimal Total { get; set; }

	[RelativityObjectField("CEDB347B-679D-44ED-93D3-0B3027C7E6F5", RdoFieldType.SingleChoice)]
	public OrderType OrderType { get; set; }

	[RelativityObjectChildrenList]
	public IList<RelatedPurchase> RelatedPurchases { get; set; }
}
```

* **Note:** 
  * For property of type `User` use `kCura.Relativity.Client.DTOs.User` *[limited support]*
  * For property of type `FileField` use `Gravity.Base.FileDto`
    * If the file is only going to be read from the server, or you can keep the files entirely in memory, use the `Gravity.Base.ByteArrayFileDto` subclass. This is the class returned by any `Get` requests.
    * If you want to use files stored on disk AND don't need to read the files from the server, you can use the `Gravity.Base.DiskFileDto` subclass.
    * Otherwise, use the base class and cast as necessary.

For Choice field you must create a enum and decorate it with the appropriate attributes:

* `RelativityObject` - Specifies the choice Guid.

The following example demonstrates a choice field represented as an Enum:
```csharp
public enum OrderType
{
	[RelativityObject("4F04381D-F3E3-4DEE-8EF9-11F27047D9B4")]
	TypeOne = 1,

	[RelativityObject("8453BF3E-D95B-4BC5-BD68-3CF4277DD731")]
	TypeTwo = 2
}
```

To use Gravity for RSAPI operations, you must instantiate an `RsapiDao` object using the `RsapiDao` constructor, with `IHelper` and `workspaceId` as parameters.

Supported IGravityDao methods:
 - `Get<T>(int artifactId, ObjectFieldsDepthLevel depthLevel)` - Get DTO by Artifact ID.
 - `Get<T>(IList<int> artifactIDs, ObjectFieldsDepthLevel depthLevel)` - Get DTOs by Artifact IDs.
 - `Delete<T>(int objectToDeleteId)`- Delete object recursively (includes child objects) by Artifact ID.
 - `Insert<T>(T theObjectToInsert, ObjectFieldsDepthLevel depthLevel)` - Insert Relativity object from RDO, updating the RDO with its new ArtifactID.
 - `Insert<T>(IList<T> theObjectsToInsert, ObjectFieldsDepthLevel depthLevel)` - Insert Relativity objects from RDOs, updating the RDOs with their new ArtifactIDs.
 - `Update<T>(BaseDto theObjectToUpdate, ObjectFieldsDepthLevel depthLevel)` - Update Relativity object from RDO, inserting any non-existing children.
 - `Update<T>(IList<T> theObjectsToUpdate, ObjectFieldsDepthLevel depthLevel)` - Update Relativity objects from RDOs, inserting any non-existing children.
 - `UpdateField<T>(int rdoID, Guid fieldGuid, object value)` - Update field value by GUID and RDO Artifact ID *[limited support]*

Additional methods supported by RsapiDao:
 - `List<T> Query<T>(Condition queryCondition = null, ObjectFieldsDepthLevel depthLevel = ObjectFieldsDepthLevel.FirstLevelOnly)` - Get all DTOs of type matching an optional RSAPI query condition

Where available, the `depthLevel` parameter controls whether (and how deeply) to recurse into object fields and child object lists. The recursion options are `OnlyParentObject`, `FirstLevelOnly`, and `FullyRecursive`.

### Example

The following example demonstrates a object "Get" used in Event handler. First we instantiate `RsapiDao` and then we use the Gravity RSAPI Dao `Get` method to get the object (`ObjectFieldsDepthLevel.OnlyParentObject` means that we want just the object - no child object fields, multiple object fields or single object fields are populated recursively):
```csharp
public override Response Execute()
{
	Response returnResponse = new Response() { Message = string.Empty, Success = true };

	RsapiDao gravityRsapiDao = new RsapiDao(this.Helper, this.Helper.GetActiveCaseID());

		DemoPurchaseOrder demoOrder =  gravityRsapiDao.Get<DemoPurchaseOrder>(1047088,
	  ObjectFieldsDepthLevel.OnlyParentObject);

		return returnResponse;
}
```
